## Availability of Support

I was supporting these cogs more thoroughly before.

I will not be doing that going forward.
If you find a security issue, feel free to reach out, otherwise it will not be changed.

I will not be removing the cogs here, people are still using them and I see no good reason to do so.


## Whats here?

Various addons for Red Discordbot. Most of these are focused around utility purposes.

Use at your own risk, they are disabled or hidden due to me not feeling they are ready for use.
