## Availability of Support

I was supporting these cogs more thoroughly before, going forward,
I'll be providing some support, but new features are unlikely.

If you find a bug or security issue, feel free to reach out, new features aren't being added.

I will not be removing the cogs here, people are still using them and I see no good reason to do so.


## Whats here?

Various addons for Red Discordbot. Most of these are focused around utility purposes.


### AntiMentionSpam

This cog provides automated actions against people spamming mentions.

Configuration is available via the `antimentionspam` command.


### BanSync

This cog provides a few functions for handling bans across multiple servers.

More help is available via `help BanSync`


### EmbedMaker

This cog provides a means to create, store, and send embedded messages from the bot.

## What about the other cogs not listed here?

Use at your own risk, they are disabled or hidden due to me not feeling they are ready for use.


## Why weren't you working on this/as invested in this anymore?

See [this](why_no_support.md)


## Why are you working on this again?

Two communities that I work closely with would like to continue using Red for now.
I am being paid for my time spent supporting the needs of these communities.
