I'm Sinbad#0413 on Discord

# Announcer

Cog for server owners to broadcast to a specific manual set of channels

# CrossQuote

Cog for quoting from any server the bot is in by just the message ID

Cog respects server privacy settings, and defaults to less permissive.

# Antimentionspam
  removes messages with above a certain threshold of mentions

# Multiquote

Quote multiple messages with a list of message IDs

# Serverblacklist

Configureable cog for maintaining a list of servers the bot will leave when invited to

# AutoRooms

Configureable Cog for generated channels.

# TempChannels

Configurable cog for allowing the creation of temporary voice channels

Warning:

This does not respect the permissions of the person calling it, it is specifically designed to bypass

needing to grant "manage channels" to people for them to create short lived voice chats.

It requires that someone who can manage channels enable it for the server.

# SuggestionBox

Configureable suggestionbox

# ReportTool

Configureable reporting tool

# LinkedChannels

links 2 channels to each other


# EmbedMaker

Tool for making embed objects, storing them, and recalling them

# PermHandler

[Basic usage doc](https://github.com/mikeshardmind/SinbadCogs/wiki/permhandler)

# AdvRoleAssign

Configureable cog for conditionally allowing people to register for roles. Intended to be used in tandem with PermHandler, but not strictly neccessary to do so.
