# SinbadCogs

Slowly growing collection of cogs for [Red](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot)

I'm Sinbad#0413 on Discord


# Announcer

Cog for server owners to broadcast to a specific manual set of channels

# CrossQuote

Cog for quoting from any server the bot is in by just the message ID

Cog respects server privacy settings, and defaults to less permissive.

# Multiquote

Quote multiple messages from the same server with a list of message IDs

# Serverblacklist

Configureable cog for maintaining a list of servers the bot will leave when invited to

Optionally you can set a message to send to the default server channel to explain this.

# tempchannels

Configureable cog for allowing the creation of temporary voice channels

Temporary channels, when enabled, last for 5 minutes if unused, or dissapear immediately

when they become empty after having been joined.

Optional setting to allow the creator of the temporary channel to own the settings of that channel.


Warning:

This does not respect the permissions of the person calling it, it is specifically designed to bypass

needing to grant "manage channels" to people for them to create short lived voice chats.

It requires that someone who can manage channels enable it for the server.
