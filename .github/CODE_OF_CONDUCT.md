This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the code provided in this respository. 

The document applies in all “collaborative spaces” in which the code is being collaborated on, which is defined as communications channels used for purposes of collaboration on the code (such as issue comments, submitted patches, commit comments, etc.).

The guidelines here reflect the values which are to be protected here.

1. Good ideas can come from anywhere.
2. Code should work for communities, not the other way around.
3. Code should not adversely impact the goodwill of the services it relies on.
4. If there is something wrong, don't ignore the issue.
5. People can work together to build something which extends beyond themselves.

With those values in mind, the guidelines which contributors should follow:

1. Participants should be tolerant of others.
2. Personal views and beliefs are not to be used to excuse harassment or any other behavior which is harmful to others collaborating.
3. Behaviour which a reasonable individual could consider to be harassment will not be tolerated.
4. When code is criticized, the criticism should be founded in the code alone. It should never be used to single out a contributor.
5. Critisism of code should be for the purpose of improving the project.
6. Code should be criticized (with the goal of protecting the project and it's users) if there is something wrong with it.

Those who violate the guidelines as written, as well as those who intentionally tow the line to violate the values expressed which these guidelines protect will be removed.

The curent point of contact for any issues arising with this is sinbadcogs-conduct@michaelhall.tech
