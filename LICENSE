0. Definitions

  "This License" refers to the text of the document.

  "The source", "The source code", "the code", "this file"
  and "these files" are terms which refer to the files 
  and the code they contain which is covered by copyright
  and licensed under this license except as superseded by
  more specific definitions.

  "Metadata file" refers to a file with the name "info.json",
  specifically intended for programmatic access by other applications.
  There may be multiple metadata files.
  Metadata files are excluded from the more general definition of "these files".
  If a clause refers to a Metadata File alongside files which
  are instead governed by the more general definition, both terms will be used.

  "You" refers to the licensee.
  The licensee may be either an individual or an organization.

  "Personal use" is a term that applies to both individuals and organizations.
  It is defined as use which is solely by and solely for an individual
  and not for the purposes of profit or redistribution.

  "Contribution" refers to any code given to the primary 
  license holder for use by the license holder to improve
  or otherwise modify the prior state of the code.

  "Fork" refers to the separately owned branch created by or for use with
  the version control software "git", or through use of interfaces
  provided by the hosting provider.

  "Pull request" refers to an action which is intended to allow 
  third-party contributions to the original licensed code,
  by the means provided by the host provider's terms.

1. Usage

  You are permitted under this license to
  download, copy, use, and compile this code for personal use.

  Your personal use may extend to users of other applications this code is used in
  so long as you do not distribute this code or otherwise imply a license to
  additional individuals or organizations.

  You may not profit off of the source or modifications made to it.
  Any profit made in connection with the source must be derived from
  inclusion in a larger product or offering which contains other works.

  Under this license, the code provided may not be used in relation with any of the following
  categories as the code has not been deemed suitable, and the owner would like to ensure
  the code can not be used in connection with specific high-risk applications without being
  further evaluated for safety.

	- Operating a medical facility.
	- Operating a facility which deals with nuclear fusion or nuclear fission.
	- Operating a facility which deals with the manufacture of weapons.
	- Operating a facility which deals with the manufacture of medicine.
	- Handling information which is protected by any government secrecy laws.
	- Handling information which is protected by any medical privacy laws.

2. Modifications
  
  You are free to make modifications for personal use as covered under section 1 (Usage)

  You may also make modifications for the additional purpose of contributions to the
  original source code.

3. Redistribution

  You may not redistribute the code or modifications made to the code
  beyond the purpose of making a pull request to the original project.

  At the time which a pull request is closed for any reason,
  you must cease any distribution of the modification within 14 days of closure.

  You may use, include, or replicate portions of the code that are not
  core to ideas expressed by the source and which have use in other projects
  so long as that use does not interfere with the operation of this code
  or interfere with data which could be used by this code on the same system.
  If you include portions in this manner, you must link back to the original
  hosted source or include it as a seperate file which also is paired
  with a copy of this license.

  A fork may be made without modification. If a fork is made without modifications,
  it does not constitute redistribution if made under the terms of the hosting provider.

  Use or operation of the code over the internet does not constitute
  redistribution unless the code itself is distributed
  to additional individuals or organizations as part of the use or operation.
  Displaying data included as part of metadata files does not constitute redistribution.

  The copyright owner may choose to offer redistribution rights
  under a separate license on a case-by-case basis, but there is no obligation to do so.

4. Non-compliance
  
  You may not distribute, copy, modify, or sublicense this code
  except as expressly permitted by prior clauses of this license.

  Any attempt to violate this license void any rights this license
  grants you, but does not invalidate protections
  and rights held by the license owner.

5. Acceptance of this License

  There is no legal requirement for you to accept the terms of this license,
  however, without accepting the terms,
  you have no legal rights to copy, modify, distribute, or otherwise use the code.

  Therefore, any copying, modification,
  distribution or other use of the code will be taken
  as having accepted the terms of this license unless
  another agreement allowing the copying, modification,
  distribution, or other use of this code exists.

  You may request a different license with other terms,
  but there is no obligation of one being agreed to or otherwise provided.
